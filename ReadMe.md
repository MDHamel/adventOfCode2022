#Advent of Code 2022

Programming exercises given via  [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022) where a new exercise is given each day in December until the 25th.

My exercises are written in **Python3**.
Each script is separated by day and has a *unique* input per user, which has been placed in an **"input.txt"** found in each directory.
